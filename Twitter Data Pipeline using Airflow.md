ETL Pipeline for Twitter Data with Apache Airflow on AWS EC2
Twitter API
Begin by researching and understanding the capabilities and limitations of the Twitter API.
Twitter Developer App
Create a Twitter Developer App and obtain the following essential API keys and tokens for authentication:
API key
API secret key
Access token
Access token secret
Python ETL Code
Write Python code for Twitter data extraction and transformation. Use the following command to install necessary Python libraries:

Copy code
pip install tweepy pandas
EC2 Instance
Launch an Amazon EC2 instance on AWS with suitable specifications.
SSH Connection
SSH into the EC2 instance using the following command, replacing YOUR_KEY.pem and YOUR_EC2_INSTANCE_IP with your actual values:

css
Copy code
ssh -i YOUR_KEY.pem ubuntu@YOUR_EC2_INSTANCE_IP
Airflow Installation
Install Apache Airflow on the EC2 instance by following the official guide for your operating system.
Airflow Configuration
Configure Apache Airflow to ensure proper installation and functionality.
Airflow DAG
Write an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) in Python that defines the Twitter ETL process. Specify tasks, dependencies, and scheduling as needed.
Connection Setup
Create necessary Airflow connections to external resources and set up any required API keys within the Airflow environment.
DAG Directory
Organize your DAG files as follows:
Create a dedicated directory for your Twitter DAG.
Place the Twitter DAG Python code and the Twitter ETL Python code within this directory.
Running the DAG
Use the Airflow Command Line Interface (CLI) to trigger and run your Twitter DAG:
arduino
Copy code
airflow trigger_dag DAG_NAME
airflow run DAG_NAME TASK_NAME
Monitoring and Troubleshooting
Regularly monitor the Airflow web interface and review log files for your DAG to identify and resolve any errors or issues.
