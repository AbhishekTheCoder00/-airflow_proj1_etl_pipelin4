ETL Pipeline for Twitter Data with Apache Airflow on AWS EC2

Twitter API:

Search for the Twitter API and understand its capabilities and limitations.
Twitter Developer App:

Create a Twitter Developer App with API keys and tokens:
API key
API secret key
Access token
Access token secret
These keys are essential for authentication.
Python ETL Code:

Write Python code for Twitter data extraction and transformation.
Use pip install to install necessary Python libraries.
EC2 Instance:

Create an Amazon EC2 instance on AWS with suitable specifications.
SSH Connection:

SSH into the EC2 instance using a command like ssh -i YOUR_KEY.pem ubuntu@YOUR_EC2_INSTANCE_IP.
Airflow Installation:

Install Apache Airflow on the EC2 instance following the official guide for your OS.
Airflow Configuration:

Set up and configure Apache Airflow.
Ensure proper installation and configuration.
Airflow DAG:

Write an Airflow DAG Python code defining the Twitter ETL process.
Specify tasks, dependencies, and scheduling.
Connection Setup:

Create necessary Airflow connections for external resources or API keys.
DAG Directory:

Organize your DAG files:
Create a dedicated directory for the Twitter DAG.
Place the Twitter DAG Python code and Twitter ETL Python code in this directory.
Run the DAG:

Use the Airflow CLI to trigger and run your Twitter DAG:
airflow trigger_dag DAG_NAME
airflow run DAG_NAME TASK_NAME
Monitoring and Troubleshooting:

Regularly monitor the Airflow web interface and log files for your DAG.
Review logs to identify and resolve any errors.
